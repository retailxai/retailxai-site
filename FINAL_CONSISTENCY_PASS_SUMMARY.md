## Summary of Changes

### Consistency Fixes

1. **Workflow trigger wording alignment** - SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md now matches SYSTEM_STATUS.md canonical wording for Protect Dashboard triggers ("On dashboard/asset changes" instead of "Push to dashboard files")

2. **Glossary completeness** - Added "Concurrency" term to GLOSSARY.md to match usage in SYSTEM_STATUS.md

3. **Build process clarity** - SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md now explicitly mentions `npm install` step to match dashboard/viewer/README.md

### Historical Doc Hygiene

4. **DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md** - Added execution status note indicating plan has been fully executed, with reference to DOCS_MAINTENANCE.md for ongoing practices

### Component README Enhancement

5. **pdfs/README.md and drafts/README.md** - Enhanced "See also" sections with links to AUDIT_REPORT.md for deeper technical context

### Onboarding Flow

6. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Added QUICK_START.md reference in Questions section to improve onboarding flow coherence

### Minor Polish

7. **GITHUB_ACTIONS_PINNED.md** - Fixed duplicate "Status:" header by renaming second instance to "Verification Status:"
