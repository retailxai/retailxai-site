## Overview

This document references the following phase diagnostic reports, which are preserved for historical context:

- **PHASE1_DIAGNOSTIC.md** - Git and workflow state diagnostic
- **PHASE2_WORKFLOW_SIMULATIONS.md** - Full workflow simulations
- **PHASE7_10_UPGRADE.md** - 10.0 upgrade mode improvements
- **PHASE8_CHAOS_MODE.md** - Failure simulation and resilience testing
- **PHASE9_MONITORING_PLAN.md** - Post-deploy monitoring plan
- **PHASE10_FINAL_REPORT.md** - Final 10.0 system audit

These phases resulted in:
- Workflow hardening (explicit branch handling, concurrency controls)
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Security improvements (XSS protection, CSP, input validation)
- System achieving 10.0/10 rating on critical categories

**Current Status:** See **[SYSTEM_STATUS.md](../../SYSTEM_STATUS.md)** for current system state.
